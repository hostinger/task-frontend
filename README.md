This is a take-home challenge from a company named Hostinger (their task description below).

[Live Version](https://martynas-hostinger.000webhostapp.com)

I also built a bonus desktop version with Flexbox for newer browsers: [this repo](https://github.com/mgalkus/task-frontend-flexbox).

### Features
- 3 breakpoints
- Adapted to older browsers (IE9 compatible)
- HTML and Scss files contain comments for information
- Source assets are divided into components and then compiled into one file using Gulp


### Down sides
- Responsive layout works badly on landscape mobiles
- Images not optimized, no lazy load

### Prerequisites
Node.js

### Installation
```
npm install gulp
```

```
npm i 
npm run start
```


### Built With:
- Vanilla Js
- Sass
- Gulp

# Frontend Developer Task

## Few simple steps

1. Fork this repo
2. Prepare pull request and let us know that you are done

## Few simple requirements

- Design should be recreated as closely as possible.
- Design must be responsive. Because we live in our smartphones and we will check with them for sure.
- Use CSS preprocessor (SCSS preferred).
- Support all modern browsers.
- Use a Javascript task-runner. Webpack, Grunt or Gulp - it doesn't matter.
- Do not commit the build, because we are building things on deployment.
- VueJS, AngularJS or ReactJS would be an advantage

## Few tips

- Structure!
- Have fun!
- Hosted DEMO would give some extra points
