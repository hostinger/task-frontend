## About

Created a website as in provided design. Some of the solutions and why I used them:

1. Used gulp to automate processes like compilation, optimization and so on.
2. Decided to fix provided background image with photoshop, but it was possible to achieve the same result with css although I think it's unnecessary. Used gulp to compress and resize images.
3. Tried to separate scss files by component for better readability. Also used BEM for css rule names and tried to maintain reusability of some elements like buttons and figures.
4. Didn't use any framework because it looks very unnecessary for this assignment.
5. Added responsive design for better ussability.
6. Used github and git for versioning.
7. Used semantic html.
8. Javascript used for advanced interactivity.

# Frontend Developer Task

## Few simple steps

1. Fork this repo
2. Prepare pull request and let us know that you are done

## Few simple requirements

- Design should be recreated as closely as possible.
- Design must be responsive. Because we live in our smartphones and we will check with them for sure.
- Use CSS preprocessor (SCSS preferred).
- Support all modern browsers.
- Use a Javascript task-runner. Webpack, Grunt or Gulp - it doesn't matter.
- Do not commit the build, because we are building things on deployment.
- VueJS, AngularJS or ReactJS would be an advantage

## Few tips

- Structure!
- Have fun!
- Hosted DEMO would give some extra points
